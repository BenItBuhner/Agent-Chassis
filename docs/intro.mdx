## What is Agent Chassis?

Agent Chassis is a **modular, scalable foundation** for building AI agents with FastAPI, OpenAI, and MCP (Model Context Protocol). It serves as a "chassis" or scaffolding for building robust agentic applications, handling the infrastructure—server management, protocol translation, tool execution—so you can focus on the agent's logic and capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (Routes, Services, Schemas)
- **MCP Support**: Native integration with Model Context Protocol servers (Stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP)
- **Hybrid Tooling**: Mix remote MCP tools and local Python functions seamlessly
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time feedback via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Session Persistence**: Optional Redis + PostgreSQL storage for conversations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user auth with Google OAuth support (OSP-14)
- **Access Control**: Ownership-based session access control (OSP-12)
- **Async & Scalable**: Fully asynchronous design using `asyncio` and FastAPI
- **Modern Tooling**: Built with `uv` for lightning-fast dependency management

### Architecture

Agent Chassis follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
app/
├── api/v1/endpoints/    # API route handlers
├── core/                # Configuration, security, settings
├── models/              # Database models (User, Conversation)
├── schemas/             # Pydantic request/response models
└── services/            # Business logic (Agent, MCP, Auth, etc.)
```

### Use Cases

- **AI Agent Development**: Build autonomous agents with tool-calling capabilities
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to external data sources and tools via MCP
- **Session Management**: Persistent conversations with Redis and PostgreSQL
- **Multi-User Systems**: JWT authentication with Google OAuth support
- **API Development**: FastAPI-based REST API with OpenAPI documentation
